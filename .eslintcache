Capitalized words are defined in the\r\n                relevant dedicated section of this document. The User must read\r\n                this document carefully. Any other contract or agreement entered\r\n                into between the Owner and the Sellers shall always prevail over\r\n                the provisions of these Terms. Therefore, in such cases, these\r\n                Terms shall apply only residually and in accordance with\r\n                applicable provisions in such agreements or contracts.

Please note that some\r\n                provisions in these Terms may only apply to certain categories\r\n                of Users. In particular, certain provisions may only apply to\r\n                Consumers or to those Users that do not qualify as Consumers.\r\n                Such limitations are always explicitly mentioned within each\r\n                affected clause. In the absence of any such mention, clauses\r\n                apply to all Users. How Bookinglane Manager works By accepting\r\n                the Terms, Users fully and unconditionally release and forever\r\n                discharge the Owner, its officers, directors, employees and\r\n                agents from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual or\r\n                consequential, direct or indirect), whether now known or\r\n                unknown, of every kind and nature relating to, arising out of or\r\n                in any way connected with: disputes between Users, or any other\r\n                person or entity, the Products’ use, including, without\r\n                limitation, any and all claims that such use violates any of\r\n                Seller’s intellectual property rights, copyrights, rights of\r\n                publicity or privacy, “moral rights,” or rights of attribution\r\n                and integrity, or Users’ activity on Bookinglane Manager,\r\n                including, but not limited to, Users’ legal capacity, ability to\r\n                complete a transaction, or pay the associated costs. User\r\n                acknowledges and agrees that the Owner has no control over, and\r\n                shall have no liability for any damages resulting from, the use\r\n                or misuse by any other person or entity of any Products. If the\r\n                Owner becomes aware of any Products that allegedly may not\r\n                conform to the Terms, the Owner may investigate the allegation\r\n                and determine in its sole discretion whether to take action in\r\n                accordance with the Terms. The Owner has no liability or\r\n                responsibility to Users for performance or nonperformance of\r\n                such activities. The Owner has the absolute right to remove\r\n                and/or delete without notice any Products within its control\r\n                that it deems objectionable. Users consent to such removal\r\n                and/or deletion and waive any claim against the Owner for such\r\n                removal and/or deletion. The Owner is not responsible or liable\r\n                for failure to store posted content or other materials Users may\r\n                transmit through Bookinglane Manager. Users shall take measures\r\n                to preserve copies of any data, material, content or information\r\n                such User posts on Bookinglane Manager. Any identity\r\n                verification methods the Owner employs is strictly on a best\r\n                efforts basis and shall not be relied upon by Users. Without\r\n                prejudice to its role as a mere technical intermediary as\r\n                described above, the Owner may provide additional services to\r\n                either party of such interaction, such as providing packaging,\r\n                shipping or facilitating dispute resolution. Bookinglane Manager\r\n                merely serves as a technical infrastructure or platform to allow\r\n                Users to interact with each other. The Owner therefore is not\r\n                directly involved in any such interactions between Users. These\r\n                Terms only apply to the described usage of Bookinglane Manager\r\n                as a platform.

Some features or functions of Bookinglane\r\n                Manager may not be available to Users during the trial period.\r\n                Further conditions applicable to the trial period, including its\r\n                duration, will be specified on Bookinglane Manager. The trial\r\n                period shall automatically convert into the equivalent paid\r\n                Product, unless the User cancels the purchase before the trial\r\n                period expires. Subscriptions Subscriptions allow Users to\r\n                receive a Product continuously or regularly over a determined\r\n                period of time. Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment\r\n                is received by the Owner. In order to maintain subscriptions,\r\n                Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner.\r\n                Failure to do so may cause service interruptions. Fixed-term\r\n                subscriptions Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the\r\n                payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription\r\n                period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the\r\n                purchasing process. Once the subscription period expires, the\r\n                Product shall no longer be accessible, unless the User renews\r\n                the subscription by paying the relevant fee. Fixed-term\r\n                subscriptions may not be terminated prematurely and shall run\r\n                out upon expiration of the subscription term. Subscriptions\r\n                handled via Apple ID Users may subscribe to a Product using the\r\n                Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using\r\n                the relevant process on Bookinglane Manager. When doing so,\r\n                Users acknowledge and accept that any payment due shall be\r\n                charged to their Apple ID account; subscriptions are\r\n                automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User\r\n                cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires; any\r\n                and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within\r\n                24-hours before the end of the current period; subscriptions can\r\n                be managed or cancelled in the Users’ Apple App Store account\r\n                settings. The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or\r\n                diverging provision of these Terms. Automatic renewal\r\n                Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment\r\n                method that the User chose during purchase, unless the User\r\n                cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination\r\n                specified in the relevant section of these Terms and/or\r\n                Bookinglane Manager. The renewed subscription will last for a\r\n                period equal to the original term. The User shall receive a\r\n                reminder of the upcoming renewal with reasonable advance,\r\n                outlining the procedure to be followed in order to cancel the\r\n                automatic renewal. Termination Recurring subscriptions may be\r\n                terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous\r\n                termination notice to the Owner using the contact details\r\n                provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the\r\n                corresponding controls inside Bookinglane Manager. Termination\r\n                notice If the notice of termination is received by the Owner\r\n                before the subscription renews, the termination shall take\r\n                effect as soon as the current period is completed.\r\n              </Typography>\r\n              <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textPrimary\" paragraph={true}>\r\n                User rights\r\n              </Typography>\r\n              <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textPrimary\" paragraph={true}>\r\n                Right of withdrawal\r\n              </Typography>\r\n              <Typography\r\n                color=\"textPrimary\"\r\n                paragraph={true}\r\n                style={{ fontSize: \"14px\" }}\r\n              >\r\n                Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw\r\n                from the contract within the period specified below (generally\r\n                14 days), for any reason and without justification.
